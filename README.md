# SnakeGame

Tech Stack : JavaScript, HTML & CSS

I have built Snake Game.
In this game you have a snake,food object and a score object which displays the score. 

Here, the player uses the arrow keys to move a "snake" around the board. As the snake finds food, it eats the food, and thereby grows larger. 
The game ends when the snake moves off the screen. When the game ends it gives a pop-up showing game over.
